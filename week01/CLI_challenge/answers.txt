question: "How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?"

  touch .hidden_file

question: "How do I create multiple nested directories?"
answer:
  -p flag with mkrdir is used to create intermediate directories as required.
  For example, command:
  mkrdir -p root/'nested 1' root/'nested 2' root\ 2/nested\ 1
  creates two root directories with nested ones while their names contain spaces.

question: "How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
first message
second message
?"
answer:
  "To add multiple lines to a file with echo, use the -e option and separate each line with \n.
  When you use the -e option, it tells echo to evaluate backslash characters such as \n for new line."
  So the answer is:
  echo -e "first message\nsecond message" >> multiple_lines.txt
